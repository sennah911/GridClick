GridClick
=========

A new way to control the mouse with the keyboard on Mac OS X.

Use Command-Alt-Space to activate then choose your target area with u/i/j/k until you are happy with the cursor position, then press ENTER to click.

    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    "                  "                   "
    "        u         "         i         "
    "                  "                   "
    "                  "                   "
    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
    "                  "                   "
    "        j         "         k         "
    "                  "                   "
    "                  "                   "
    """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can also move the mouse to the different intersections with Command-[h/j/k/l]
